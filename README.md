Hello EveryOne,

This Android Application showcases ExoPlayer HLS Video playback functionalities.<Enter>
I have used Texture-View as asked.(I can also do Surface-View if need be, i prefer Texture-View).


Most of functionality that you might be interested in lies in this 
[code](https://github.com/anuragkumarak95/YoBluntAssingment/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/yoblunt/anuragkumar/yobluntassingment/adapter/HlsListAdapter.java).

You can easily find APK file for the same app [here](https://github.com/anuragkumarak95/YoBluntAssingment/blob/master/APK%20File/yobluntAssignment_v0.0.1S.apk).
    
**Thank you**.

Environment Specifications:
